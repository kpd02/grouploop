<br>
<h2>Why use Group Loop?</h2>
<p>Group Loop has a multitude of features to make managing a group project easy
Members are able to assign tasks and see when a person completes a task. Not only that,
a progress bar tracks the completion of the assignment as well as individual progress bars for
assigned tasks.<br>
Another feature are the easy 'To Do' and 'Completed' task boxes. These make it easy to see when tasks are to be completed,
  which tasks need to get done and which ones are completed. Uncompleted tasks are also ranked by their completion date, allowing
  you to see which tasks are due soon.<br>
</p>
<h2>About the Creators</h2>
<p>
Group Loop was created by a group of four high school students. Gabi and Jenna, are rising Juniors while the other two founders,
  Katie and Lucia, are rising Seniors. They were inspired to make this after being tired of unreliable members in group projects
  and how hard it was to divide tasks between members. Group Loop was their solution, a website to make it easy for members in a group project to collaborate and
  finish a project on time. This website is the final project for the Seattle AT&T Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Camp.<br>
