<p> Group Loop is designed and coded for students, by students. However, we want to make it useable for teachers as well.
  Teachers will be able to make Teacher accounts, allowing for a new range of options available to teachers only. The ablility
  to create classes with a list of students, and create groups for projects is the newest feature for Teachers. The group
  creation will have the option of randomized or customized groups.</p>
