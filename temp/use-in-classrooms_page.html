<p> groupLoop is designed and coded for students, by students. However, we want to make it useable for teachers as well.
  Teachers will be able to make Teacher accounts, allowing for a new range of options available to teachers only. The ablility
  to create classes with a list of students, and create groups for projects is the newest feature for Teachers. The group
  creation will have the option of randomized or customized groups.</p>
